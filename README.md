# Web Audio API Demo

Just playing around with some parts of [this tutorial.](https://ui.dev/web-audio-api/)

This stuff feels fairly 'low-level,' and it's quite challenging to abstract things. In every _event handler,_ it's kind of compulsory to 're-create' all of the things agai. There are numerous settings that woudl get ugly ðŸšŽ really quickly to try to make into _constructor function._ ðŸ¤”

Summarily, it feels like this has to be quite _imperative_ code, and is another example of something that is a bit of a 'specialty' and we would be better off to use a library for this one.
